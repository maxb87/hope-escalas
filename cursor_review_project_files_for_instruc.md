**User**

Read through the project , especially the @Gemfile , the @models/  , @routes.rb  and @README.md and ask for instructions

**Cursor**

Scanning the key files you highlighted to understand the stack and current domain models before proceeding. I’m going to open the model files in parallel now.

Quick check of more files to understand routing and setup before asking next steps. Reading routes, Gemfile, README, and relevant migrations in parallel.

Just reviewed the key files you mentioned. High-level picture:
- Rails 8 with Devise, Pundit, Paranoia, Turbo/Stimulus, PostgreSQL, Lograge/Prometheus.
- `User` is Devise-authenticated and polymorphic to `Patient`/`Professional`.
- `Patient` and `Professional` have soft delete enabled and `has_one :user`.
- Routes expose full CRUD for `patients`/`professionals`, Devise auth, and an API namespace for `api/v1/users` (controller not present yet).
- README outlines desired flows (first login reset, magic link), soft-delete, and ops/dev setup.

How would you like me to proceed? Pick one or more:
- Implement soft delete fully: add `deleted_at` to `patients` and `professionals` and wire scopes.
- Lock down authorization: add Pundit policies for `Patient`/`Professional` and apply in controllers.
- Finish Devise flows: enforce first-login password change; optionally add confirmable/lockable.
- Implement `api/v1/users` controller and serializers for the existing routes.
- Build magic link flow (token model/logic, mailers, routes, controller).
- Seed/admin setup: seeds for an admin `Professional` + sample `Patient`/`User`.
- Tests: model validations/associations + request specs for patients/professionals.
- Observability: enable Lograge and a basic Prometheus exporter endpoint.

If you want, I can also prepare the DB and run the app/tests locally. Tell me the priority and target environment (dev vs prod-like).

Make a checklist for:

mplement soft delete fully: add deleted_at to patients and professionals and wire scopes.
Lock down authorization: add Pundit policies for Patient/Professional and apply in controllers.
Finish Devise flows: enforce first-login password change; optionally add confirmable/lockable.
Implement api/v1/users controller and serializers for the existing routes.
Build magic link flow (token model/logic, mailers, routes, controller).
Seed/admin setup: seeds for an admin Professional + sample Patient/User.
Tests: model validations/associations + request specs for patients/professionals.
Observability: enable Lograge and a basic Prometheus exporter endpoint.

And keep track of it as we interact

Skimmed the files you pointed out. I’ll maintain a running checklist and update statuses as we progress.

### Checklist (initial status: all To do)
- [ ] Soft delete (Paranoia) for `patients` and `professionals`
  - [ ] Migrations: add `deleted_at:datetime` + index to `patients`, `professionals`
  - [ ] Confirm `acts_as_paranoid` on models (`Patient`, `Professional`)
  - [ ] Ensure controllers/scopes don’t accidentally expose soft-deleted rows
  - [ ] UX: optionally add “Restore” flow if needed
  - [ ] Specs: soft delete and restore behavior

- [ ] Authorization with Pundit
  - [ ] Ensure `ApplicationController` includes `Pundit::Authorization` and verification callbacks
  - [ ] Policies: `PatientPolicy`, `ProfessionalPolicy` (define `index/show/create/update/destroy?`)
  - [ ] Scopes: restrict records appropriately (e.g., professionals only)
  - [ ] Controllers: call `authorize` and use `policy_scope`
  - [ ] Specs: policy and controller authorization tests

- [ ] Devise flows: first-login password change; optional confirmable/lockable
  - [ ] Add a flag on `users` (e.g., `force_password_reset:boolean` default false)
  - [ ] Enforce redirect to password update when flag is true
  - [ ] Optionally add `:confirmable` and/or `:lockable` (update model + migrations)
  - [ ] Update `User` modules and mailer templates if enabling confirmable
  - [ ] Specs: first-login redirect and module behavior

- [ ] API `api/v1/users` (controller + serializers)
  - [ ] Controller: `Api::V1::UsersController` with `index`, `show`
  - [ ] Auth: require authenticated user (and policy scope)
  - [ ] Serialization: Jbuilder views (`index.json.jbuilder`, `show.json.jbuilder`)
  - [ ] Specs: request specs for `index`/`show`

- [ ] Magic link flow
  - [ ] Model: `MagicLinkToken` (references user/patient, token_digest, expires_at, used_at, purpose)
  - [ ] Generation: service to issue token and email link
  - [ ] Mailer: send link with signed/hashed token
  - [ ] Routes: create and consume endpoints (single-use + expiry)
  - [ ] Controller: consume token → sign in → redirect per role
  - [ ] Specs: token lifecycle (issue, consume, expire), request specs

- [ ] Seeds/admin setup
  - [ ] `db/seeds.rb`: create admin `Professional`, sample `Patient`, related `User` records
  - [ ] Set `force_password_reset` true for first login
  - [ ] Document default credentials in README (dev only)

- [ ] Tests
  - [ ] Model: associations/validations (`User`, `Patient`, `Professional`)
  - [ ] Request: `patients`/`professionals` CRUD with Pundit enforcement
  - [ ] API: `api/v1/users` request specs
  - [ ] Magic link: service + request specs
  - [ ] SimpleCov target ≥ 90%

- [ ] Observability
  - [ ] Enable Lograge in `production.rb` (and optional dev)
  - [ ] Add `prometheus_exporter` middleware/initializer
  - [ ] Expose metrics endpoint and basic Rails/DB metrics
  - [ ] Smoke test metrics export locally

Would you like me to start with soft delete migrations and Pundit wiring, or prioritize another section? I’ll mark progress here as we complete items.

- Implemented: none yet
- Next suggested step: soft delete migrations + Pundit base setup

Summary:
- Prepared a concise, actionable checklist covering soft delete, Pundit, Devise flows, API, magic links, seeds, tests, and observability.
- Ready to begin with your chosen priority; I’ll update this list as we proceed.

**User**

add deleted_at:datetime + index to patients, professionals and users current migrations (do not create new migrations, we are setting up the database)

---

**Cursor**

I’m going to open the existing migration files for `users`, `patients`, and `professionals` to add `deleted_at:datetime` and an index directly in those files, as requested. Then I’ll apply the edits.

Reading the existing `patients` and `professionals` create migrations to add `deleted_at` and its index directly.

Adding the missing index for `deleted_at` on `users` in the existing migration.

```ruby
# frozen_string_literal: true

class DeviseCreateUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration[8.0]
  def change
    create_table :users do |t|
      ## Database authenticatable
      t.string :email,              null: false, default: ""
      t.string :encrypted_password, null: false, default: ""

      ## Recoverable
      t.string   :reset_password_token
      t.datetime :reset_password_sent_at

      ## Rememberable
      t.datetime :remember_created_at

      ## Trackable
      # t.integer  :sign_in_count, default: 0, null: false
      # t.datetime :current_sign_in_at
      # t.datetime :last_sign_in_at
      # t.string   :current_sign_in_ip
      # t.string   :last_sign_in_ip

      ## Confirmable
      # t.string   :confirmation_token
      # t.datetime :confirmed_at
      # t.datetime :confirmation_sent_at
      # t.string   :unconfirmed_email # Only if using reconfirmable

      ## Lockable
      # t.integer  :failed_attempts, default: 0, null: false # Only if lock strategy is :failed_attempts
      # t.string   :unlock_token # Only if unlock strategy is :email or :both
      # t.datetime :locked_at
      t.datetime :deleted_at

      t.timestamps null: false
    end

    add_index :users, :email,                unique: true
    add_index :users, :reset_password_token, unique: true
    add_index :users, :deleted_at
    # add_index :users, :confirmation_token,   unique: true
    # add_index :users, :unlock_token,         unique: true
  end
end

```

Made the requested migration edit: added an index on `users.deleted_at` in `db/migrate/20250811184631_devise_create_users.rb`. I’ll run a linter check for the modified file and update the checklist progress.

- **Change applied**: Added `add_index :users, :deleted_at` to `db/migrate/20250811184631_devise_create_users.rb`. The `patients` and `professionals` create migrations already include `deleted_at` and indexes.
- **Lint**: Clean.

Checklist updates:
- [x] Soft delete (Paranoia) migrations
  - [x] Users: `deleted_at` + index
  - [x] Patients: `deleted_at` + index (already present)
  - [x] Professionals: `deleted_at` + index (already present)

Want me to run `bin/rails db:prepare` to initialize the DB now, or proceed to the next checklist item (Pundit wiring)?
