[Devise] Could not find devise mapping for path "/".
This may happen for two reasons:

1) You forgot to wrap your route inside the scope block. For example:

  devise_scope :user do
    get "/some/route" => "some_devise_controller"
  end

2) You are testing a Devise controller bypassing the router.
   If so, you can explicitly tell Devise which mapping to use:

   @request.env["devise.mapping"] = Devise.mappings[:user]

AbstractController::ActionNotFound (The index action could not be found for the :verify_policy_scoped
callback on Devise::SessionsController, but it is listed in the controller's
:only option.

Raising for missing callback actions is a new default in Rails 7.1, if you'd
like to turn this off you can delete the option from the environment configurations
or set `config.action_controller.raise_on_missing_callback_actions` to `false`.

AbstractController::ActionNotFound (The create_direct action could not be found for the :ensure_professional_or_admin
callback on ScaleResponsesController, but it is listed in the controller's
:only option.

Raising for missing callback actions is a new default in Rails 7.1, if you'd
like to turn this off you can delete the option from the environment configurations
or set `config.action_controller.raise_on_missing_callback_actions` to `false`.

AbstractController::ActionNotFound (The create_direct action could not be found for the :ensure_professional_or_admin
callback on ScaleResponsesController, but it is listed in the controller's
:only option.

Raising for missing callback actions is a new default in Rails 7.1, if you'd
like to turn this off you can delete the option from the environment configurations
or set `config.action_controller.raise_on_missing_callback_actions` to `false`.

AbstractController::ActionNotFound (The create_direct action could not be found for the :ensure_professional_or_admin
callback on ScaleResponsesController, but it is listed in the controller's
:only option.

Raising for missing callback actions is a new default in Rails 7.1, if you'd
like to turn this off you can delete the option from the environment configurations
or set `config.action_controller.raise_on_missing_callback_actions` to `false`.

AbstractController::ActionNotFound (The create_direct action could not be found for the :ensure_professional_or_admin
callback on ScaleResponsesController, but it is listed in the controller's
:only option.

Raising for missing callback actions is a new default in Rails 7.1, if you'd
like to turn this off you can delete the option from the environment configurations
or set `config.action_controller.raise_on_missing_callback_actions` to `false`.

AbstractController::ActionNotFound (The create_direct action could not be found for the :ensure_professional_or_admin
callback on ScaleResponsesController, but it is listed in the controller's
:only option.

Raising for missing callback actions is a new default in Rails 7.1, if you'd
like to turn this off you can delete the option from the environment configurations
or set `config.action_controller.raise_on_missing_callback_actions` to `false`.
